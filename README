# Purpose: nginx install via Ansible

# Comments: - Ansible is not designed to be a single script for all distros. Scripts are written 
#             for a specific OS. Therefore, this script is written for CentOS 6.
#           - If you already have a /var/www/<servername> webserver operating, your
#             index.htm will be replaced.
#           - You can change port number from 8080 by modifying nginx_setup.yml's port_num variable.
